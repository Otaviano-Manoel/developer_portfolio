-   [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation was essential for understanding how to use hooks, routing, and other React features correctly and efficiently.

-   [ChatGPT](https://www.openai.com/chatgpt) - I used ChatGPT to solve some complex logic and problems I encountered during development. It was helpful for obtaining solutions and code formatting suggestions.
